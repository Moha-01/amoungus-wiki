      <p class="aside_p">Abilities are a game mechanic in Among Us that allow players to interact with the map and view information about other players. Some abilities are limited to certain roles, while others can be used by all players.</p>

        <p class="aside_p">Abilities appear as large buttons in the bottom-right corner of players' screens, each with different purposes. Each role has a default ability: the Crewmates' is use, and The Impostors' is Sabotage. Standing near security systems such as Admin will replace the default ability with the security system's appropriate ability. An Impostor standing near a vent will have their default ability replaced with vent, while if they stand near a panel to resolve a Sabotage, next to the Decontamination doors, or next to the emergency button it will be replaced with use. Similar to assigned tasks which have yellow outlines, certain abilities such as Admin, Security, Doorlog, Vitals and Customize have white outlines to them, while vent and kill (which only appear when getting close to the interactive object or player) have red outlines.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="aside_p">Report is positioned above the default ability and is usable whenever the player is near a dead body. Kill is positioned to the left of the default ability and is usable whenever the player meets the criteria to kill a Crewmate. The player must be An Impostor, have their kill cooldown at zero, and be within a certain range from a Crewmate, which depends on the game's options.</p>
