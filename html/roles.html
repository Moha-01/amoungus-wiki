              <h2>Overview</h2>
          </div>
          <p class="aside_p">Both the Impostor and Crewmate roles are shown when a game of Among Us begins. However, the ghost role can only be obtained through being killed by An Impostor or by being ejected. There are currently three roles in Among Us: Crewmate, Impostor, and ghost. Each role has different abilities and mechanics. For example, Impostors have access to Kill, Sabotage, and Vent.</p>

          <br>
          <p class="aside_p">Crewmates make up the majority of players in Among Us, and must complete tasks while staying alive and figuring out who is or is not An Impostor. The Crew wins once all their tasks are complete, or there are no living Impostors left in the game.</p>
          <p class="aside_p">Crewmates, also known as Crewmembers or The Crew, are one of the two possible randomly assigned roles in Among Us.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Goals:</p>
          <p>The primary goal of a Crewmate is to complete all tasks without being killed by An Impostor, with the secondary goal of finding all Impostors and ejecting them off the map. Crewmates who have been killed by An Impostor or ejected become ghosts.</p>
          <br>
          <p>There are two ways for Crewmates to win:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>All Crewmates (including ghosts) complete all their tasks.</li>
              <li>All Impostors are eliminated from the game.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <p>Impostors are primarily eliminated through ejection votes, but leaving, disconnecting, or being kicked also contributes towards the elimination goal.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The Crewmates are assigned a variety of tasks such as Fix Wiring, Upload Data, Fuel Engines, etc.</p>

              <h2>Impostor</h2>
          </div>
          <img class="welcome_img" src="./assets/imposter.png" alt="Impostor">
          <br>
          <p class="aside_p">Impostors serve as the Crewmates' enemy, and must kill the Crew while avoiding being ejected. The Impostors win when at least half of the living players are Impostors or the countdown for a critical Sabotage, such as Oxygen Depleted, reaches zero.</p>
          <p class="aside_p">The Impostor is one of the two possible randomly assigned roles in Among Us. Their goal is to kill the majority of the Crewmates to win.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Goals:</p>
          <p>The primary goal of The Impostor(s) is to kill enough Crewmates to have an equal amount of Impostors and Crewmates before all tasks are completed.</p>
          <br>
          <p>All Impostors cannot complete any tasks; however, they are given a fake task list as general guidance on feigning a Crewmate's behavior and blending in with them. Additionally, Impostors have the ability to Sabotage to force Crewmates to resolve issues, with some killing all Crewmates if not resolved in time. This ability can be used in many different ways, such as luring Crewmates away from a body or concealing a kill.</p>
          <br>
          <p>There are two ways for Impostors to win:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Crewmates being eliminated by leaving, being killed, or being ejected until they no longer have a voting majority (one Crewmate per Impostor left).</li>
              <li>Enacting a critical Sabotage that is not resolved in time.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <p>Impostors primarily eliminate Crewmates through a combination of killing them during gameplay and manipulating or confusing the Crew into ejecting innocent players. Crewmates leaving, disconnecting, or being kicked from the game also contribute towards this goal.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>Probability of Being An Impostor</h3><p>Depending on the game options, there can be one to three Impostors in a game. Impostors are randomly chosen when the game begins. Therefore, every player has an equal chance to be The Impostor. This chance does not change regardless of any player's record as An Impostor or Crewmate or their color; it is consistently random between all players.</p>

          <img class="welcome_img" src="./assets/ghost.jpg" alt="Ghost">
          <br>
          <p class="aside_p">Ghosts are an additional role that players obtain when they are killed or ejected. Crewmate ghosts must continue to complete tasks, while Impostor ghosts can assist living Impostors by Sabotaging. If the Crewmates win, so do all Crewmate ghosts, and if all Impostors win, so do all Impostor ghosts.</p>
          <p class="aside_p">Ghosts are players who have been killed by an Impostor or ejected by other players. Both Crewmates and Impostors can be ghosts.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Overview:</p>
          <p>Ghosts have no collision (aside from the invisible wall at the edge of the map) and can freely travel through walls. They are invisible to both living Crewmates and Impostors but can be seen by other ghosts. They also have unlimited vision, which is not restricted by walls, the photo room in the Main Hall on The Airship or Fix Lights. They are slightly faster than living players. Ghosts cannot assist during any Sabotages, such as Reactor Meltdown or Oxygen Depleted. However, the arrows will still point towards the Sabotage.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Ghost Crewmates can still complete their tasks. However, Submit Scan will not give a visual cue. This is most likely to prevent Impostors from pretending they are scanning and Crewmates from becoming confused. However, the name that appears when another person is already scanning will appear.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Goals:</p>
          <p>Crewmate:</p>
          <p>Ghost Crewmates must complete their given tasks, similar to their living counterparts, to fill the task bar. Once all Crewmates, including ghosts, finish their tasks, the game ends with a Crewmate victory.</p>
          <p>Impostor:</p>
          <p>Ghost Impostors must aid their fellow Impostors by Sabotaging to help achieve a victory for The Impostors.</p>
