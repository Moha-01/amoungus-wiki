      Players are able to select between 18 different colors using the customize ability in the lobby: Red, Blue, Green, Pink, Orange, Yellow, Black, White, Purple, Brown, Cyan, Lime, Maroon, Rose, Banana, Gray, Tan and Coral. The player's selected color does not directly affect gameplay, and only directly affects the player's in-game appearance. The only exception was Fortegreen, who was not legitimately playable in-game and caused numerous bugs when played as. Each color also has a unique color ID; for example, Red's is 0, and Yellow's is 5. Fortegreen was an exception to this rule, however, as it occupied all IDs of whole numbers above 11, examples being 12, 13, and 100. As of version 2021.2.21, Fortegreen's color ID was removed from the code so it cannot be accessed by ID.
